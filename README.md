# Monopoly
[Play Here](sleepy-cray-d4bb81.netlify.com)
This project was completed in one week. 
If you've never played monopoly and would like to learn, click [here](https://www.hasbro.com/common/documents/A0AFE3A69EC745EBA77B9A7950BBCA44/AD7742057B1D43609B53D24D75E9CA9B.pdf).
I did not have time to implement every feature of the game. There is no Community Chest or Chance cards. Hotels and Houses cannot be sold and properties cannot be mortgaged. Properties cannot be auctioned. All other elements of the game have been implemented.

  -This one photo is two players so the game would end quicker

### Getting Started
Step 1: There must be at least 2 players and a maximum of 8 players.
  Each player will be assigned their own color icon that moves around the board.
Step 2: Click on the roll dice button.
  Your turn will immediately end after clicking that button. If you'd like to trade or buy houses/hotels, do so before rolling the dice.
How to Win: When a player loses all their money they are out of the game. Last player left is the winner.
Note 1: The "Buy Houses" and "Buy Hotels" will only display when a player is able to make the purchase
Note 2: If a player loses all their money by landing on another players property: 1) All houses and hotels of the properties of the losing player will be removed 2) The properties will then be transfered to the other player
If a player loses by landing on a "Tax" space: 1) All houses and hotels of the properties of the losing player will be removed 2) The properties will be available for purchase when a player lands on it
**IMPORTANT**: When trading, the current player must enter a dollar amount and/or a property to trade with ONE other person. Also, do not enter more money than the player has. Doing this any other way will break the game.

### Next Steps
If I go back to work on this game, first I will:
* Make it impossible for the user to break the game when trading.
Then I would implement every feature of the game, such as:
* Community Chest
* Chance
* Selling Hotels & Houses
* Mortgaging Properties
* Auctioning Properties
Lastly, I would implement a better UI:
* Dice rolling across the screen
* Various sound effects
* Player icons
* Better positioning of icons
* and more...
